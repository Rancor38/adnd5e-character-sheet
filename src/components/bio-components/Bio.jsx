                Hello! I'm Zakariah! I'm a creative soul that loves building things, and I recently learned software engineering at General Assembly!

                For years, while working in food service to make ends meet, friends tried to convince me to get into tech. They all told me it would be tough to make the change, but that it’d be worth it. So I signed up for General Assembly, and that, is where I find myself today, and I’m having a blast knowing that the best of times are yet ahead.
