# My Portfolio Site

This project is a [React](https://reactjs.org/) application, and is my portfolio website.

You can find the live site [here](https://zakariah.xyz)

## Purpose

Hello, welcome to my website! This site is a showcase of a few of the things that I do for work. The menu details a few different pages to look over.
* The Skills page details the software and development tools that I use the most often, and while it's not a comprehensive list of every tool that I've used in my life, they are the spread of them that I feel confident in.
* In Projects you'll find an array of published applications and other projects that I've been proud to work on.
* Resume is a direct link to download my most recent (and hopefully up-to-date) resume.
* And Contact Me has a few ways to reach out/find me online!.
